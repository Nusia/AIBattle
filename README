AIBattle is a topdown shooter game where two teams will compete against each other. 
Roles as assault, bomber, medic etc. can be in your team. 
The difference from traditional games is that when the game starts, 
you as a player no longer have any control! 
Your task is that you on beforehand set a number of different AI-settings 
to make your units act the best possible way against the enemy.

The latest working executable will always be up and working.
Just click the "Downloads"-button on the upper right-hand side 
to download everything and check out the game. ^_^
