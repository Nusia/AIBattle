AIBattle is a topdown shooter game where two teams will compete against each other. 
Roles as assault, bomber, medic etc. can be in your team. 
The difference from traditional games is that when the game starts, 
you as a player no longer have any control! 
Your task is that you on beforehand set a number of different AI-settings 
to make your units act the best possible way against the enemy.

The latest working executable will always be found in /bin.
Just download and test it. ^_^
